				<span class="big-letter">H</span>i! I'm Sarah Maston. I am not a doctor. I am a hobbyist. I am also an architect of intelligence systems and databases. <br>

				I have studied obesity, nutrition and the pathophysiology of the digestive system for a decade, originally in an attempt to correct my own declining health. I approached my malfunctioning digestive system like I was debugging a computer program with no documentation that I had to reverse engineer. As a result, I designed a food program that has been shown to reverse different aspects of metabolic syndrome and return the body to nutritional balance. Or as I like to say, "Everybody has hobbies."
				<br>
				I teamed up with my friend Norma Gaffin a number of years ago on this project and some others. I have known her since high school and together we got what was in my head onto this website. She's really good at speaking "Maston." (it's a thing)

				<h4 class="intro-text">There Had to Be a Reason – and a Solution: Debugging Obesity</h4>
				<p class="intro-text"> 
					My thinking was this: The body is a culmination of processes that work together to maintain a level of homeostasis. I knew there must be a way to determine which processes move the body out of balance to produce metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome comes in a number of guises as different combinations of conditions; it is an amazing process problem if you think about the body holistically as a giant software system.

			<section class="col-md-12">
				<h4 class="intro-text">I Ate My Way into This…</h4>
				<p class="intro-text">
					Foods have properties the digestive system uses as tools to reverse damage and regain normal functionality. My food program leverageS the digestive organs’ inherent intelligence and the properties of certain foods given in a specific order of operations.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section  class="col-md-12">
			<h4 class="intro-text">The Process Is Repeatable</h4>
			<p class="intro-text">Understanding what broke helped us fix ourselves. There have been three stories of metabolic rebalance, where individuals were able to achieve measurable results within a three-month period. These stories have served as a beacon of hope to a small community. In one case a woman lost 80 pounds and continues to inspire her friends as she communicates her journey.</p>
